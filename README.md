# robo-arm-viz
Robotic arm visualizer. Want to build something from scratch (no AI) using new NeoVim setup.
Coming along nicely, got a bit technical with the inverse kinematics solver ! Vim is really fun. To run just do below in env with pygame (weird download so no req.txt):

```bash
python main.py
```
